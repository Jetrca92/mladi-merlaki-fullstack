                        Whenever humanity wanted to create something, it needed initial capital. In slavery, the ruling class 
                        forced slaves into work, while in communism, capital was exclusively extracted through taxes. In late 
                        feudalism and capitalism, those at the top of the pyramid invented more sophisticated methods of acquiring 
                        capital: bonds and stocks. Today, individual investors can buy both on the stock exchange with the help of 
                        a brokerage firm.

                        In 12th century Italy, cities borrowed money from citizens and promised to repay it with interest, 
                        calling these financial instruments bonds. If a city faced the possibility of losing a war, bond prices on the 
                        secondary market would drop sharply. Those who took the risk and bought bonds at a discounted price could earn 
                        a lot if there was an unexpected victory but could lose everything if the city was defeated. Later, private companies 
                        began issuing bonds as well. If the company goes bankrupt, it must first pay the bondholders before paying the 
                        shareholders. Bonds are generally considered a safer investment than stocks, but they may offer lower returns.

                        In 1602, the Dutch East India Company needed funds for trade with India and created a financial instrument called a 
                        "share" or "stock." Each share paid regular dividends, averaging 17%. This meant that the owner of a share received 
                        their entire investment back in just 6 years, and the influx of dividends continued for another 198 years until the 
                        company ceased operations in 1799. Like bonds, shares can also be sold on the secondary market. When the dividend 
                        flow is solid, the share price rises, and vice versa. In the former case, we speak of a capital gain, and in the latter 
                        case, a capital loss.

                        Exchange-Traded Funds, or ETFs, were first introduced in the early 1990s as a way for investors to gain exposure to a 
                        basket of stocks or other assets in a single trade. Like stocks, ETFs are traded on exchanges. They offer diversified 
                        portfolios with lower fees and greater liquidity than mutual funds. ETFs can track various assets and provide exposure 
                        to sectors, themes, or regions. For example, an investor could buy an ETF that tracks the S&P 500, giving them exposure 
                        to a group of large-cap stocks.

                        Cryptocurrencies are a relatively new financial instrument. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that use cryptography 
                        to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. They are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled 
                        by any government or financial institution. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009. 
                        Cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold on various exchanges, and their prices can be highly volatile. While 
                        cryptocurrencies offer the potential for high returns, they also come with high risk, as their prices can fluctuate 
                        rapidly. As a result, cryptocurrencies are often considered a highly speculative investment.
